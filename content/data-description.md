To explore the fascinating world of beer reviews, we utilize the comprehensive Beer Advocate dataset. This dataset originates from a popular app that has compiled over 1.5 million beer reviews over a decade, up until November 2011. Each review captures detailed evaluations across five key aspects: appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression. Our primary focus will be on analyzing these reviews to understand the overall impression of each beer, uncovering trends and patterns that define what beer enthusiasts truly appreciate.
