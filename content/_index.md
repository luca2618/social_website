## **Are there different communities or archetypes of beer drinkers?** 
Through our website, we aim to answer this question and provide insights into the network of beer enthusiasts. You may even recognise what type of casual beer drinker you are yourself.

## **Our Interest in This Project**
Our team is driven by a curiosity about the social dynamics within the beer community. By analyzing the shared reviews, we can map out a network of preferences and opinions, connecting people who might never have meet but share similar tastes in beer. This approach allows us to discover underlying patterns and perhaps even predict future trends in beer ratings and preferences. 

## For who
It's a cultural exploration that appeals to marketers, brewers, and sociologists alike. For enthusiasts and connoisseurs, understanding the nuanced perceptions of various beers can enhance their appreciation and guide their choices. Marketers and brewers can leverage these insights to better align their products with consumer preferences, tailoring their strategies to meet the discerning tastes of their audience.

By participating in this exploration, visitors to our website can gain deeper insights into what makes a beer stand out and how collective opinions shape the beer landscape. Whether you're a data geek, a brew master, or just someone who enjoys a good pint, this project has something intriguing to offer.
