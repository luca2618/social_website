## **Constructing the Network**
The network we created from dataset, consisted of 2 types of nodes. Person nodes and beer nodes, each interlinked by a person review of a beer. Ultimately we were interessted in communities of beer drinkers, and therefore projected the network onto the people nodes. Furthermore we weighted each edge between 2 people with the sum of an agreement score for each beer they shared.
