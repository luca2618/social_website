To delve into the intriguing world of beer reviews, we are leveraging the extensive Beer Advocate dataset. This dataset is derived from a popular app and encompasses over 1.5 million beer reviews collected over a decade, concluding in November 2011. Each review provides detailed assessments across five key dimensions: appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression. Our analysis primarily aims to decode the overall impression of each beer, identifying trends and patterns that capture what beer enthusiasts truly value.

In order to manage our dataset more efficiently, we split the original dataset into two smaller sets: one containing the review scores and the other containing the review texts. 

To simplify our analysis and ensure the uniqueness of the data, we retained only the most recent review from each user for any given beer, effectively eliminating duplicates. This process confirmed that there were no duplicates in our final dataset, which contains 1,560,428 reviews.

Recognizing the vast size of our dataset, we opted to narrow our focus further by honing in on the casual beer drinker or reviewerâ€”a demographic that most people can relate to. We specifically targeted users who have posted between 10 and 100 beer reviews, allowing us to capture a broad yet relevant perspective on beer appreciation among average consumers. This targeted approach helps us to provide more relatable insights into the world of beer tasting and enjoyment.
